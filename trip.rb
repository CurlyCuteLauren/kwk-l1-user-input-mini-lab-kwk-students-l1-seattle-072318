# Code your prompts here!

# First, puts out a string asking where the tourist would like to stay.
puts "Let's plan your trip! Where would you like to stay?"

stay= gets.strip.capitalize # Then, set a variable called stay to get the user's input. Make sure to capitilize that input.

stay = gets.chomp.capitalize 

"What do you like to eat?" 
eat=gets.strip
"How many nights would you like to stay?" 
nights = gets.strip
# Do the same thing with `eats` and one last time with `nights`, capturing their text input and storing them to the respective local variable



# Lastly, puts it all back by interpolating these values in a string.

puts ""
